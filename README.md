# AquaHUD
A simplistic, modern UI resource pack designed to compliment Sodium's UI.

# About
Upon installing sodium, I immediately found it rather annoying that it's user interface was completely different from the rest of minecrafts. So, I took it upon myself to create a resource pack that attempts to complement Sodium's user interface in a way that makes every screen feel consistent and like it was meant to look that way. This has been in development for quite a while, so there may be some inconsistencies with some UIs, and also the various people who made Mincraft's user interface are all idiots who have no idea how to program or make texture maps.

# Permissions
YOU MAY NOT REDISTRIBUTE THIS IN ANY FASHION UNLESS IT IS A DIRECT FORK TO THIS SPECIFIC GITHUB, ON GITHUB. ABOSLUTELY NO OTHER PLATFORMS MAY HOST AQUAHUD OR ANY FORK OF IT, EVER.

Now that that's clear, any usage of AquaHUD in videos, screenshots, etcetera, must be given credit and a link to AquaHUD. I will not pursue anyone who does not credit or link to AquaHUD, but I will be unhappy, and if it happens too many times I'll just make this private again. You've been warned. Be a decent human being and don't ruin it for everyone.

# Pull Requests
I will look at any pull request submitted to AquaHUD, but pull requests will only be considered if they:
 * Follow the general design philosophy of AquaHUD and Sodium's UI.
 * Explain your changes thoroughly
 * Explain why you think your change should be considered (i.e. what's wrong with the original, and why yours is better)

# Requirements
The only requirement is my SemiTranslucency mod. It is supported on Forge 1.16.5 and Fabric 1.16.5, 1.17, and 1.17.1. It will not be backborted, so don't ask.
